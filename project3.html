            <h2>Key Insights and Observations</h2>

            <h3>1. Bounce Rate Comparison</h3>
            <img src="img/app_web/comparison_bounce_rates.png" alt="Comparison of Bounce Rates" />
            <p>From 2020 to 2023, bounce rates for mobile users increased sharply, surpassing 58% by 2023, while desktop bounce rates remained relatively stable around 50%. This indicates that mobile users are more likely to leave a site without engaging, compared to desktop users.</p>

            <h3>2. Visit Duration on Desktop</h3>
            <img src="img/app_web/desktop_visit_duration.png" alt="Desktop Visit Duration" />
            <p>Desktop visit duration has shown a significant decline, dropping from 80% to 40% over three years. This trend highlights that while desktop visitors spend more time initially, this engagement has decreased over time, reflecting a shift towards quicker interactions on mobile.</p>

            <h3>3. Pages per Visit for Desktop Users</h3>

            <p>The percentage of desktop users viewing more pages per visit has increased, peaking at 100% by 2023. This suggests that although desktop usage is declining, those who do use it tend to engage more deeply with the content.</p>

            <h3>4. Mobile Visit Increase</h3>

            <p>Mobile visits have surged significantly, growing by over 300% between 2020 and 2023. This reinforces the dominance of mobile as the primary access point for web platforms, with users shifting from desktop to mobile devices.</p>

            <h3>5. Web vs. App Usage Across Platforms</h3>
            <img src="img/app_web/newplot.png" alt="Web vs App Usage by Platform" />
            <p>For platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, app usage dominates (60% for most platforms), while news platforms like BBC and The New York Times see more balanced usage. This shows the importance of optimizing both app and web experiences to cater to diverse user preferences.</p>

            <h3>6. Distribution of Age Groups Across Platforms</h3>
            <img src="img/app_web/output.png" alt="Age Group Distribution" />
            <p>The distribution of age groups across platforms highlights that younger users (18-34) dominate social media and streaming platforms like Facebook, Netflix, and Spotify, while older users (35-54) are more prevalent on news and professional platforms like LinkedIn and CNN.</p>

            <h3>7. Web vs. App Visits Forecast</h3>
            <img src="img/app_web/predictions.png" alt="Web vs App Visits Forecast" />
            <p>Future predictions show that mobile app visits will continue to grow at a faster rate than web visits, with app visits projected to reach over 200,000 by 2026. In contrast, web visits are expected to increase at a much slower pace, reinforcing the trend of mobile-first engagement.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Overall, mobile app usage has seen significant growth, with more users shifting away from desktop in favor of quick, convenient interactions on mobile. However, desktop platforms still maintain higher engagement rates per visit, particularly for more in-depth content consumption. Businesses should optimize both mobile and web experiences to cater to user needs across different platforms and age groups, focusing on mobile-first strategies for social media and entertainment, and maintaining robust web experiences for news and professional tools.</p>
