            Hello, I'm <strong>Adrian Moroianu</strong>, a 34-year-old living in Essen, North Rhine-Westphalia. I was born in a small city called Tulcea in eastern Romania. My journey began with a desire to pursue a career in civil construction, so I started studying <strong>Land Surveying</strong> and <strong>Geodesy</strong> at the University of Civil Construction in Bucharest.

            However, life took an exciting turn in my third year at university when I attended the Wacken Festival in Germany, where I met the love of my lifeâ€”who is now my wife. That moment changed everything, and I made the bold decision to drop out of university, call my parents, and tell them I wasnâ€™t coming back home. ðŸ™‚
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the past 11 years in Germany, Iâ€™ve navigated various jobs, from cleaning services and garbage disposal companies to working in production factories, construction, and installations. Whatever needed an extra hand, I was there!
        </p>
        <p>
            As a longtime video game enthusiast and someone whoâ€™s been working with computers from a young age, I decided to follow my passion for tech. I enrolled in a one-year <strong>DCI course</strong> for back-end Python development and, at the same time, pursued a <strong>Google certificate</strong> in data analytics.
        </p>
        <p>
            During this journey, I fell in love with the world of <strong>data analysis</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong>. Now, my goal is to build a career in this exciting field, where I can combine my skills in Python, data analysis, and my love for solving complex problems.
